# 🗓️ Day 14 of Summer Training:

Today was the 14th day of my summer training.........

## 💡 What I Learned Today:
- I learned about form validation, what are various objects and function inside useform hook.
- Learned about register function, handleSubmit function.
- How to do form vidation using react-hook-form.
- How to do form validation using Zod and what are its alternatives like yup.
- How to use resolvers, how to integrate react-hook-form and Zod using resolvers.
- How to show error messages to the user.
- How to give custom error messages using Zod.

## 💪 What Challenges I Faced:
There was nothing much difficult today just, I have to practice the things again and again as everything is new and also the syntax is quite different from previously learned technology. I got stuck at resolvers because first of all react-hook-form is new and on that we have used Zod for data validation and now we are using resolvers to kind od bridge both of them so a lot of stuff which takes time to get into the brain.

## ✉️ Reflection and My Feelings:
Just going with the flow lots of learning every day trying to digest things. Trying to fix problems and taking steps to make the routine better every day.
