# 🗓️ Day 6 Of Summer Training

Today was the 6th day of my summer training.....

## 💡 What I Learned Today
- Today I learned how to set up a theme with jekyll and push it to github pages. It was a process full of errors. I spend a large chunk of time in solving the errors and finally set up the jekyll on github.
- The second thing I learned about is to change the font of website according to user needs.

## 📝 What Project I Worked On:
Today I again worked on the project which I started yesterday, today I worked on the font handling of the website means that I have provided the user with three options to set the font of the website. Website can be seen in three fonts:
- Sans
- Sans-Serif
- Mono

```html
<div class="font-handling-container relative">
                <div
                  class="selected-font-container flex align-center box-content gap-18 clickable"
                >
                  <p class="selected-font font">Mono</p>
                  <svg
                    xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"
                    width="14"
                    height="8"
                    viewBox="0 0 14 8"
                  >
                    <path
                      fill="none"
                      stroke="#A445ED"
                      stroke-width="1.5"
                      d="m1 1 6 6 6-6"
                    />
                  </svg>
                </div>
      
                <div
                  class="font-selection-container flex flex-col gap-15 box-border absolute hidden"
                >
                  <p
                    class="font margin-0 font-option clickable sans-serif font--sans-serif"
                    data-font="sans-serif"
                  >
                    Sans Serif
                  </p>
                  <p
                    class="font margin-0 font-option clickable serif font--serif"
                    data-font="serif"
                  >
                    Serif
                  </p>
                  <p
                    class="font margin-0 font-option clickable mono font--mono"
                    data-font="mono"
                  >
                    Mono
                  </p>
                </div>
              </div>
```

## 🎯 What Challenges I Faced:
The thing which caused me headache was setting up this blog with jekyll and github page. I almost spend 2-3 hours just jumping between errors and their solutions. But finally this thing is working. Sometime ruby build was failing and on the other time site test check was failing. Because of that I was not able to even send the blog to my mentor but now set up is done, I send him both the blogs.

## 🙏🏻 Whom I am Thankful To:
It is quite difficult to think the content for this section because you can go in a wide range for this like we can even consider the code editor in my case vscode, thanking the developers for developing the software.I don't know how you think about this.
This section help to think in a more like crazy way for gratitude.

## 💭 Reflection and My feelings:
This training is no doubt adding value to my knowledge, but it is also helping me get to track again which I was not able to do because of some reason. It's like in the morning there is new energy & vibe to learn new things and give my best. So folks do the hard work and rest is the destiny.
