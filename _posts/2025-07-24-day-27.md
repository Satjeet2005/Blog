# 🗓️ Day 27 of Summer Training

Today was all about enhancing the **data-fetching logic and UI flow** in React applications. I focused on building a flashcard-based quiz system, managing **API delays, error handling**, and improving **user experience** with smoother conditional rendering.

---

## 💡 What I Learned Today

- Understood how **React Strict Mode** causes double requests during development, which helped debug an unintended duplicate API call.
- Learned how to **control multiple API requests** using **`AbortController`** and when to avoid excessive requests to prevent **429 (Too Many Requests)** errors.
- Mastered techniques to safely handle **`undefined` or delayed data** by using conditional checks before rendering.
- Used `useEffect` along with state guards (`if (!data) return;`) to prevent rendering errors due to empty or undefined arrays.
- Improved component reliability by avoiding premature access to API-dependent data like `questions[0]`.

## 🧪 What Project I Worked On

- Built a **Flashcard quiz system** where each card shows one question at a time.
- Implemented navigation logic to **move to the next question** only after the user responds.
- Ensured that flashcards don’t break even if the data arrives late or partially.
- Integrated error boundaries for cleaner UI fallback when an error like API failure occurs.
- Added conditionals to render flashcards only after data is available using safe checks (`questions?.length > 0`).

---

## 🎯 What Challenges I Faced

- Encountered the `'questions' is possibly 'undefined'` TypeScript error due to asynchronous data arrival.
- Accidentally sent two API requests due to React’s Strict Mode — initially confusing, but fixed by checking lifecycle behavior.
- Implemented `AbortController` for better request handling but had to manage edge cases like 429 errors.
- Flashcard rendering failed when data was empty — resolved with loading states and guards.
- Debugging conditional rendering edge cases became tricky with deeply nested components.

---

## 🔍 Key Takeaways

- Always handle **API state (loading, success, error)** explicitly in React components.
- Avoid referencing potentially undefined data — use optional chaining and fallback UI.
- Flashcard systems require **tight control over question flow** and state synchronization.
- React Strict Mode can trigger duplicate renders — account for this in development.
- Implementing **defensive UI patterns** like fallback messages, loaders, and empty states greatly improves UX.
