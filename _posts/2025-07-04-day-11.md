# 🗓️ Day 10 of Summer Training
Today was the 10th day of my summer training.....

## 💡 What I Learned Today:
- Today I learned about various javascript functions, one of them being **padStart**.
- Today I learned about the working of pomodoro timer.
- Learned to make various functions of the Pomodoro timer like start, reset, and pause.

## 📝 What Project I Worked On:
Today I again worked on the **Pomodoro Web App**, I finally completed the project today. I made all the functions like timer start, timer stop, mode change, format time, and various other functions to make the pomodoro
timer to work. I also worked on the feature that prevents the user from changing the duration of the timer when the timer is in use, also we can not change the mode when a timer is in a  running state. Pomodoro web app 
also has a feature to save time when we switch between various modes like short breaks, long breaks, andthe  pomodoro timer.

## 🎯 What Challenges I Faced:
The main challenge I faced was to build the logic to make the pomodoro timer work. I had no idea how to make one, but after searching the web, I found the core logic of the timer, which helped me to think 
further. This thing was quite confusing because there were a lot of things to take care of and a lot of functions, also working with time in JavaScript seems difficult. The different modes also created a problem 
because you have to keep track of the three timers' time left and various other things.

## 💭 Reflection and My Feelings:
I feel very happy because, I have succesfully completed my project.
