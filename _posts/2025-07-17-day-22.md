# 🗓️ Day 22 of Summer Training:
Today was the 22nd day of my training....

## 💡 What I Learned Today:
- Today, I learned how to trigger a form validation using a function call through the parent component.
- Learned how to get the input field value.
- How to retain data in form using **`useEffect`**.
- How to deploy a React app on GitHub.
- How to handle conditional rendering.

## 📝 What Project I Worked On:
- Today, I deployed the multi-step form on GitHub.
- Now it's time for the final training project, so I searched for some projects that I can make for the final project.
- So, I decided to make a quiz web app.
- I found some designs to get inspiration and get started.
- I set up the environment for development.

## 🎯 What Challenges I Faced:
- Yesterday I completed the project, but when I tested it today, there were a lot of errors.
- So I fixed the form because it was not retaining the information entered by the user when the user came back to the form.
- So I used `useEffect` to handle it.
- Triggering the form with a button that is outside its container was also a problem.
