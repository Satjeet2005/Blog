# 🗓️ Day 25 of Summer Training:
Today was the 25th day of my training...

## 💡 What I Learned Today:
- I explored how to work with **SVG icons** more deeply — especially how `viewBox` affects rendering and responsiveness.
- Understood how to scale SVGs to the **exact size** needed without distortion or extra spacing.
- Learned about **inline SVG styling** — including how margins don’t really work inside SVG but can be mimicked via surrounding containers or transforms.
- Realized that **font-weight values** like `550` don’t work, and you need to stick to standard weights (e.g., `400`, `500`, `600`).
- Converted a large SVG `style` block into a proper **TypeScript object** usable in React components.

## 📝 What Project I Worked On:
- Worked on improving the icon system for the quiz app, focusing on consistency and responsiveness.
- Took a detailed SVG icon and stripped down unnecessary styles.
- Cleaned up the inline SVG by writing styles in proper **TypeScript-friendly format** for JSX compatibility.
- Used container `<div>`s to handle positioning, spacing, and sizing instead of bloating the SVG with layout concerns.
- Ensured the icons render pixel-perfect inside React components — with proper scaling and theming support.

## 🎯 What Challenges I Faced:
- Initially confused why `viewBox` wasn’t rendering the icon as expected — had to manually tweak it to match the icon’s real bounds.
- Tried adding `margin` directly to SVG — didn’t work as expected, so wrapped it inside a container div with padding/margin.
- Struggled a bit with that huge `style` string inside the SVG — converting it to a TypeScript object manually was tedious but worth it.
- Ensured the custom select component doesn’t break when embedded next to SVG icons — needed extra spacing and alignment tweaks.
- But overall, today gave me a better understanding of **how SVGs behave in modern UI** and how to properly integrate them with React logic and styling.
