# 🗓️ Day 16 of Summer Training
Today was the 16th day of my summer training.....

## 💡 What I Learned Today:
- Today I learned about how to write cleaner React code.
- How to make different files and modules concerning different functions.
- How to make a generic API request structure.
- How to make a concrete structure and how to pass data between components elegantly.

## 📝 What Project I Worked On:
- Today, I started working on the game searching web app.
- I worked with the basic layout, like the navbar, main content, and aside bar.
- I am using Chakra UI for designing.
- I made the card component and fetched the name, ID, and background image of games.
- I also included the theme change option, i.e, toggling between light and dark theme or vice versa.
- I also made a custom hook for fetching the list of games.


## 🎯 What Challenges I Faced:
- As I'm new to React, TypeScript, and also to Chakra UI, it takes some time to understand the stuff.
- For this project, I am following along with the tutorial to get an idea of how to make different components where the interface should be and to separate modules based on functionality.
- It also takes time to understand the errors, what this error wants to convey, and how to solve it.
- The syntax of React with TypeScript is also away from vanilla JavaScript syntax.
- Although there are various challenges but it will be worth it, and I will be happy to write that I have learned React with TypeScript on LinkedIn.
