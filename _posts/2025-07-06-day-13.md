# 🗓️ Day 13 of Summer Training:

Today was the 13th day of my summer training.........

## 💡 What I Learned Today:
- I have learned a lot of things today, like using vanilla CSS, CSS modules, CSS in JS, and also about inline styles.
- Learned about the popular React icon library.
- How to update primitive data, objects, arrays, and arrays of objects using useState.
- What is strict mode, and how does it render the content twice?

## 🗂️ What Project I Worked On:
I am not currently working on any project, but along with the course. I am practicing some exercise questions to improve my logic and understand things.

## 💪 What Challenges I Faced:
I was a little stuck on forms; there were various things in the form, like form submission, using useRef, useState and useform and how to access different fields. Updating objects using useState was also a little tricky. But with practicing them various times I understood the concept.

## ✉️  Reflection and My Feelings:
Although the tutorial videos are quite small but a lot of things are happening and it takes time to grasp it. Practicing things side by side to make the learning more effective.
