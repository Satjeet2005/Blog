## 🔖 What I Learned Today

- Today I learned about open source contribution how pull requests work, what is the roadmap in order to contribute to the community, how talking with the maintainers is important before even start to code talking is the first and foremost step.
- Then I started the other project which is dictionary web app which also gives meaning, synonyms, pronunciation with a user-friendly theme.

## 📁 What Project I Worked On

Today I worked on dictionary web app nav bar today I mainly worked on the theme change section which consists two things one is the toggle button and other is a moon icon. I analyzed the hover state and how the icon or button behaves on click event, then I started with HTML
in which to stimulate a toggle button, I used two divs. If we click on the toggle button or icon it will toggle the theme and I also tried to implement the feature that examines the user preferred theme(light/dark) and use that theme on the website.

Examples:
```html
<header>
      <nav>
        <div class="flex align-items gap-15">
          <div
            class="scroll-btn flex align-center p-3 box-border clickable relative"
          >
            <div class="scroll-ball absolute"></div>
          </div>
          <img src="/assets/icon-moon.svg" alt="moon" />
        </div>
      </nav>
    </header>
```

I honestly haven't faced any difficulties and challenges today, everything was quite smooth.

## 💭 Reflections and My Feelings

Today the schedule was quite hectic, it was difficult to manage training with it, but I managed to work for eight hours and why shouldn't I because priorities matter. The things having the highest priority must to done at any cost.
