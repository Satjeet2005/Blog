## 🎯 What Challenges I Faced:
- I tried various designs for my project, then got a decent one but actually not got everything in one design
  something from one project and something from other.
- I tried emojis, svg, images, icons etc. But not suited, so made a simlpe yet impressive cards.
- One thing I want to talk about is today I felt satisfied and happy because I actually understood code and coded as I like.
- Also trying various designs is fun but have to control yourself that choose things according to the time.
