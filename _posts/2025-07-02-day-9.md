# 🗓️ Day 9 Of Summer Training
Today was the 9th day of my summer training.....

## 💡 What I Learned Today
- Today I learned about transitions and made a slide-in transition.
- I also learned about SVG and how to control how the SVG looks.

## 📝 What Project I Worked On:
Today I started a new project, which is a Pomodoro timer. Today, I worked on the mode switch between the pomodoro timer, short break timer, and long break timer. I also worked on the settings panel
which provides the user with the ability to change the font, color, and most importantly, to change the pomodoro timer, short break timer, and long break timer. Tomorrow, I will work on the actual Pomodoro timer, which
is the most difficult and crucial task of this project.

## 🎯 What Challenges I Faced:
Today I faced challenges due to my health, my allergy caused problems today, even after taking medicine. I was not able to give my best, although I worked as much as possible. Tomorrow I will try to give my 
best and try to complete the project.

## 💭 Reflection and My Feelings:
I am trying to complete this project as soon as possible because after completing this project only, I will be able to start what I actually want to learn. Let's see how much time it takes. I will try to complete
The project tomorrow itself. I have to figure out how to make the pomodoro timer, especially with that border on the timer which decreases with time. Tomorrow, with new energy and vibe, let's start again with the project
So, folks bye take care.
