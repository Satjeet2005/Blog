# 🗓️ Day 26 of Summer Training

Today marked the 26th day of my summer training. I spent the majority of my time diving deeper into **SVG rendering, customization, and integration inside React components** — focusing specifically on sizing, alignment, and converting raw inline styles into maintainable TypeScript-compatible structures.

---

## 💡 What I Learned Today

- How the `viewBox` property influences **rendering, scaling**, and **responsiveness** in SVGs.
- The right approach to scale SVGs **without distortion** and align them precisely in React layouts.
- Discovered that **margins inside SVGs don’t work** — spacing should be handled externally via containers.
- Learned about font-weight compatibility — values like `550` are ignored; use `400`, `500`, `600` instead.
- Rewrote a bulky inline SVG `<style>` block into a clean **TypeScript object** compatible with JSX.

## 🧪 What Project I Worked On

- Focused on improving the **icon system** in the quiz application.
- Took a cluttered inline SVG and **stripped out unused styles** and metadata.
- Converted the SVG styles into a **clean, modular React-friendly object**.
- Managed SVG alignment inside a custom select dropdown by using **container divs** for layout.
- Ensured pixel-perfect rendering and scaling using `viewBox`, `width`, and `height` adjustments.

---

## 🎯 What Challenges I Faced

- `viewBox` misalignment initially caused layout issues — fixed by manually adjusting dimensions.
- Tried using `margin` inside SVG elements — realized it only works when applied outside via a parent div.
- Rewriting SVG `style` as a TypeScript object was **time-consuming** but a great learning process.
- Ensuring proper alignment between **SVG icons and form controls** like custom selects was tricky.

---

## 🔍 Key Takeaways

- SVGs require **layout discipline** — avoid inline bloat and offload spacing to parent elements.
- Always **verify the viewBox** — it's the heart of how SVG scales.
- Treat SVG icons like **React components** — modular, reusable, and style-safe.
- Converting styles from SVG exports into React-compatible objects improves **maintainability** and **theming support**.
- Debugging SVGs takes patience — inspect visually and tweak based on real render bounds.
