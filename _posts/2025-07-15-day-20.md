# 🗓️ Day 20 of Summer Training
Today was the 20th day of my summer training.....

## 💡 What I Learned Today:
- Today I learned how to store static data and display it.
- I learned how to structure the architecture of the files for cleaner and easier code and file management.
- I learned practically about the props, value passing via props, and also about function passing via props.

## 📝 What Project I Worked On:
- Today, I worked on step 2 of the form, which is to select the plan.
- The user can select between the arcade, advanced, and pro plans, each having its own price.
- The user can also select between the plan type, either monthly or yearly.
- I also made step 3 of the form, which is to select the addons.
- Each addon has its own price, and the price shown depends on the type of plan selected, either monthly or yearly.

  ## 🎯 What Challenges I Faced:
- I successfully made the form that is used in step 1 of the multi-step form, and I started working on step 2.
- After making other steps, when I tested it, it started giving an error, which I searched on Google and ChatGPT, but I haven't found the solution.
- Tomorrow I will find the solution and try to complete it.
