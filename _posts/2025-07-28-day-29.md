# 🗓️ Day 29 of Summer Training

Today's focus was on **data visualization and customizing UI behavior** in charts — specifically using the **Recharts library** to build interactive and styled **Pie charts**. I dove deep into how to tweak visual elements like label lines, sector coloring, and hover behavior to match the app’s design needs.

## 💡 What I Learned Today

- Learned how to customize **label lines** in Recharts using `labelLine` with a custom function.
- Explored **math behind label positions** using `sin`, `cos`, and `midAngle` for precise control over line direction and length.
- Understood how `cx`, `cy`, `outerRadius`, and `innerRadius` relate to layout and chart placement — they're all **coordinate-based and pixel-dependent**.
- Implemented **dynamic coloring** for chart sectors and label lines based on data index or values.
- Used **SVG elements like `<polyline>`, `<circle>`, and `<text>`** to build sharp and responsive chart labels.

## 🧪 What Project I Worked On

- Customized a **Recharts PieChart** to show answer correctness (right/wrong) with two colored sectors.
- Replaced default labels with **custom label lines**, directional arrows, and text annotations that adjust based on angle.
- Added small **dots at the start** of each label line for better visual clarity.
- Extended logic to show **different stroke colors** per line and even **text content at the end of each line**.
- Tuned layout so charts only **occupy required space** and don’t break responsiveness.

## 🎯 What Challenges I Faced

- Faced layout issues where chart or image had **zero rendered width** — turned out to be due to `max-width: 100%` without a proper container width.
- Struggled initially to make label lines behave consistently — learned to normalize direction using math (e.g., always angle outward).
- Confused by `midAngle` initially — but realized it's key for **controlling label direction** in radial layouts.
- Had to tweak state values and coordinates multiple times to prevent labels from going off-screen.
- Figuring out how to use percentages in charts (instead of raw values) took some trial and error with custom formatting.

## 🔍 Key Takeaways

- In Pie charts, **every visual element is mathematically placed** — small miscalculations can skew the entire layout.
- Using **custom label renderers** unlocks full control but requires careful handling of geometry.
- Be mindful of container widths — tools like `ResponsiveContainer` don’t magically fix everything without a **defined parent size**.
- SVG elements in React give powerful control — from lines to text to dots — and respond well to props and styles.
- Even in data visualization, **React state and prop flow remain essential** — especially when rendering dynamic UI tied to data values.
