# 🗓️ Day 18 of Summer Training
Today was the 18th day of my summer training.....

## 💡 What I Learned Today:
- Today I learned about writing clean code in react and refactored react code.
- Also learned how to use static data.
- How to use components like <Menu> from Chakra UI.
- How to use <List>, <HStack>, <Button> components.
  

## 📝 What Project I Worked On:
- I finally completed the project which was building along with the course.
- Today I worked with game filter which render games based on the platform selected by the user, It includes various platforms like windows, linux, android, ios, nintendo, playstation etc.
- I also worked on the functionality to show a fake image like a no image to stimulate a smoother user experience.
- I have worked on static data where the data like platforms or genres of games are saved in the codebase itself instead of sending api requests.
- Worked on the search functionality, where user can search for games.
- User can also select the sort order like based on rating, relevance, date released, name etc.

## 🎯 What Challenges I Faced:
- As I am using chakra UI v3 so there are breaking changes in v3, chakra UI has changed various things but the course I am following uses v2.
- So when the whole project was ready there was some errors in chakra UI files whose solution was not available on the internet or copilot was also not able to solve the problem.
- I spent 2-3 hours in that, the end solution was to degrade the version now I am working on that.
- Also the storage in my linux system is full, I have to apply some trick to increase its storage but there is risk of losing everything and both the operating systems.
