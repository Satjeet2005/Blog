# 🗓️ Day 2 of Summer Training
Today was the second day of my summer training.....

## 💡 What I Learned Today
Got to work with the progress tag in HTML, which is used to show the percentage. I learned how to style the progress, but we have to take care to style it according to different browsers. So learned to make a progress like simulation using divs. Learned how to make logic to count characters with spaces and without spaces.Learned to use a map in JavaScript.

## 🗂️ What Project I Worked On:
I worked on the project, which I started yesterday in which the user simply enters some text system will analyze the text and give the number of characters, number of words and number of sentences and will perfectly handle the various cases like a large space between the words or there are more then one fullstops after sentence completion, it handle all cases and give accurate results.

It also shows detailed analyses of text, like the occurrence of each character or number, and the percentage of each character, and uses progress to show the percentage.

## 💪 What Challenges I Faced:
The main challenge I faced was designing the checkbox because the design I used as a reference used various things while designing it, like it used all things outline, border, box-shadow and also at various states on focus state it looks different, on checked it looks different and also on theme change it should look accordingly so it took me sometime to design it. Also, I never worked with a progress bar, which was not that difficult, but it was the first time I dealt with that thing.

## 🙏🏻 Whom I am Thankful To:
There can be a long list of those we are thankful to, because knowingly or unknowingly a lot of people help us in various ways.
But,
First and foremost, I want to thank the almighty god for giving me the opportunity and all the power to deal with problems and challenges, because there is no point being in the battlefield when you don't know how to wield a sword.
I am also thankful to the company and to my mentor for guiding me today.

## ✉️  Reflection and My Feelings:
Initially before starting the project, I thought that it would take less time to make a junior-level project
because I made the projects earlier but it took almost two days to make it also it will take some hours to properly complete it. Today I gave my best and gave more than eight hours honestly. I also tried to improve the blog writing from yesterday because my mentor actually read what I had written. Let's see if he reads it today or not. I do not know how my further training days will go but one thing is sure that this training will push me more out of my comfort zone.

## ⚡Last But Not Least:
Thank you to whoever has read this blog. May god bless you, take care.BYE!!
