# 🗓️ Day 4 Of Summer Training
Today was the 4th day of my summer training.....

## 💡 What I Learned Today
Today I learned about git and GitHub, and it was a very exciting experience. Firstly, I learned about git commands from the simplest one to check the git version to git rebase, also learned about which commands are necessary, which we must use carefully, and Learned about merging and stashing, how merging can be easy, and it can cause a headache when conflicts enter the game. How a stash copied from one branch can be popped in other branches, also viewing the practical version of how the git rebase command can play with timelines, and also sometimes mess up things. I learned about SSH to push local machine code to GitHub, and practiced commands for a lot of times.

## 📝 What Project I Worked On:
Today I haven't started any new project, just fixed the earlier one, which was not giving accurate results in some cases, which was pointed out by my mentor, so I fixed it.

## 🎯 What Challenges I Faced:
As I was learning git and GitHub, everything was pretty smooth. I was actually able to understand the stuff . I struggled a little at merging because I was using the git graph extension to see the actual image of the branches the master branch, and other branches. How are they connected? How do they get merged after the merge command? So when I was doing merging, I was unable to see a different branch from the main branch, and when I merged, it was not showing how the branches were getting merged, so I figured out why it was not showing. I also struggled a little with the integration step of GitHub on my machine.

## 🙏🏻 Whom I am Thankful To:
I am thankful to the great coder from whom we learn a lot of stuff, none other than Hitesh Choudhary, having a YouTube channel Chai aur Code, from where I have learned about git and GitHub today. I am also thankful to my mentor because he pointed out the mistakes in the project, which I improved.

## 💭 Reflection and My feelings:
Today it was easier to sit for eight hours than yesterday. For the past days, when my training started, I was doing stuff in a hurry because of the thought that my mentor would ask how I spent the 8 hours, if I thought in that way, it was a weight on my head, but today I made myself relaxed and today I actually enjoyed learning than yesterday also I will continue this and will enjoy the learning and will learn a lot.
