# 🗓️ Day 12 Of Summer Training

Today was the 12th day of my summer training.....

## 💡 What I Learned Today
- Today I learned about react useState, props, variable passing using props, function
passing using props.
- Also got to know about how react and react-dom work to detect changes in virtual DOM and how they change it.
- Learned about Virtual DOM data structure.

## 📝 What Project I Worked On:
I haven't worked on any project today because I have started learning react after learning it, I will start a project, although the course I have following teaches things by actually building a project side by side.

## 🎯 What Challenges I Faced:
The things which I learned today where new for me and new things seems tuff but by watching the tutorial 2-3 times I understood the things also by actually practicing the things side by side which where taught in the tutorial made things easier and understood.

## 💭 Reflection and My feelings:
I was very excited to start learning react and now I am learning it. I take some time even to watch small tutorial because I generally watch the tutorial 2-3 times and some time even more. At first time I only analyze what is happening, what things are going on here and try to understand things so that they make sense. In second and third time I try to do it practically and try to play with the stuff, moving things here and there, changing variable names and try to understand things.

## 🙏🏻 Whom I am Thankful To:
I am thankful to my mentor, he is very generous and try to help me out in every problem I am facing.So
**THANK YOU VERY MUCH**😊.
