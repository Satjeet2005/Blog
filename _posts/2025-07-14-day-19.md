# 🗓️ Day 19 of Summer Training
Today was the 19th day of my summer training.....

## 💡 What I Learned Today:
- Today I learned about form building, form validation, and their integration using resolvers.
- Learned about various CSS tricks to responsively change the layout according to screen size.
- Learned how to do form validation using Zod.
- Learned to write a schema for data validation.

## 📝 What Project I Worked On:
- Today, I started another practice project, which is a multi-step form.
- Today I worked on the basic layout and made the first step of the form.
- The first step of the form consists of an actual form where the user enters his/her name, email address, and phone number.
- I wrote a schema for validation and also custom error messages to show whenever an error occurs.
- I used React Hook Form for building the form and to handle data submission.
- In React hook form, I used useForm, formState, handleSubmit functions, and an object to complete form building.

## 🎯 What Challenges I Faced:
- The challenge I faced today was not understanding my own code.
- I was doing code just to make things work at any cost. ( Mindlesly adding properties)
- I want the code to be clean and well understood in my brain.
- I thought that I should restart the project, but then I tried to refactor the code to make it cleaner and more understandable.
