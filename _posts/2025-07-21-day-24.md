# 🗓️ Day 24 of Summer Training:
Today was the 24th day of my training...

## 💡 What I Learned Today:
- I learned how to make a selection component that feels clean and intuitive.
- I explored how to style select tags in modern CSS and how color plays a big role in UI.
- I learned how to fetch data based on category and use that info dynamically.
- Understood how to keep accessibility in mind using ARIA tags.
- Learned how to add icons to enhance UX and how to choose icons that go with the meaning.

## 📝 What Project I Worked On:
- Continued working on the quiz app project.
- Today I focused on making a **Selection Component** where user selects:
  - Number of questions
  - Difficulty (Easy, Medium, Hard)
- I also added the selected tag so that the user knows what difficulty is selected.
- Made a card layout to keep things clean, used subtle border and background colors to keep it minimal and beautiful.
- Also finalized the max number of questions dynamically based on selected category using the API data.
- Started writing the JavaScript logic for the custom select component and kept it organized for better maintainability.

## 🎯 What Challenges I Faced:
- Selecting between input and dropdown for number of questions — but finally chose a select as it gives better control.
- Styling the native select tag in plain CSS took time but I kept it modern and theme-friendly.
- Deciding the color palette that looks clean on white card — went with shades like `#e2e8f0` and `#94a3b8` that felt subtle.
- Also took time deciding icons for difficulty levels — wanted them to make sense and be visually clean.
- But overall, enjoyed building something custom, with complete control on design and logic.
