# 🗓️ Day 21 of Summer Training
Today was the 21st day of my summer training, and I’m happy to share that I’ve **successfully completed the multi-step form project** using React and Typescript.

## 💡 What I Learned Today:
- I understood how to trigger child component methods from the parent using **`useImperativeHandle` and `forwardRef`**.
- I learned to structure React code **cleanly by separating logic** and keeping **each step modular**.
- I explored how to pass state and functions deeply while still keeping the code manageable and scalable.
- I also understood how to show a **summary of the selected data** at the final confirmation step.

## 📝 What Project I Worked On:
- I completed the **multi-step form project**, which includes four steps:
  1. **Step 1**: Collect user details (name, email, phone) with validation.
  2. **Step 2**: Let users choose a **plan** (Arcade, Advanced, or Pro) and switch between **monthly/yearly** pricing.
  3. **Step 3**: Allow users to select optional **addons** with pricing that updates based on plan type.
  4. **Step 4**: Show a clear **summary** of selected plan, plan type, and addons before final confirmation.

- I handled all transitions between steps and ensured data was preserved using **central state management in App.tsx**.
- I made sure the form only allows proceeding if the first step is valid.
- The form was styled with **vanilla CSS**.

## 🎯 What Challenges I Faced:
- I initially got an error while using `ref` to trigger validation, but I solved it by properly **typing the ref interface**.
- Handling the **checkbox selection** for addons dynamically and ensuring real-time updates in the parent state took some trial and error.
- Managing **type safety** with TypeScript across components and passing form data cleanly required attention to detail.
- Overall, I overcame all issues and now the form works exactly as expected — I’m proud of how it turned out!
