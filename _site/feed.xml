<p>Today was the 7th day of my summer training‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶</p>

<h2 id="-what-i-learned-today">üí° What I Learned Today</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Today I learned about async await although, I know about it earlier but today I revised it again thorough my project.</li>
  <li>Today I learned to play audio by a click on a svg image like we do in google to listen the pronunciation of a word.</li>
  <li>I also learned to work with dictionary API, how to get data, how to retrieve desired data, how to handle errors.</li>
  <li>I also tried to use clean code practices in project.</li>
  <li>Also as I know git &amp; github now and my also using that in my project.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="Ô∏è-what-project-i-worked-on">üóÇÔ∏è What Project I Worked On:</h2>
<p>Today I worked on the project, I was doing earlier. I mainly worked with API today. The task was to fetch the data and retrieve desired data from it. There were various things to do like to get the mp3 audio of the pronunciation of the word, word‚Äôs meaning when used as noun, verb and adjective. It was so tedious to work with this API to get the phonetic of a word or to get the meaning I have to write a lot of code because the data which, I was getting was so unstrutured. I have to take care of lot of things. Also I added a thing which was not in the project was to show a message if there is no audio pronunciation available for a word.</p>

<h2 id="-what-challenges-i-faced">üí™ What Challenges I Faced:</h2>
<p>The main challenge was to know to target which data or element inside the json object which I was getting. So literally opened different tabs in browser and I analysed the object which I was getting from 5-6 different words then I got to know which data or element to target. Everything else was good.</p>

<h2 id="Ô∏è--reflection-and-my-feelings">‚úâÔ∏è  Reflection and My Feelings:</h2>
<p>I have successfully completed my first week of training it was a very good experience. I also sent the weekly clocify (a time tracker) report to my mentor. With god‚Äôs grace I am actually enjoying this training journey. There was a little hiccup on saturday, I don‚Äôt know how accidently the time tracker was kept on for the entire night it calculated around 35 hours, so I have to edit the time spend then I sent the report to my mentor.</p>]]></content><author><name>Satjeet Singh</name></author><category term="HTML" /><category term="CSS" /><category term="Web Development" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[üóìÔ∏è Day 7 Of Summer Training]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Day 6 of Summer Training</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2025/06/28/day-6.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Day 6 of Summer Training" /><published>2025-06-28T00:00:00+05:30</published><updated>2025-06-28T00:00:00+05:30</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2025/06/28/day-6</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2025/06/28/day-6.html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="Ô∏è-day-6-of-summer-training">üóìÔ∏è Day 6 Of Summer Training</h1>

<h2 id="-what-i-learned-today">üí° What I Learned Today</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Today I learned how to set up a theme with jekyll and push it to github pages. It was a process full of errors. I spend a large chunk of time in solving the errors and finally set up the jekyll on github.</li>
  <li>The second thing I learned about is to change the font of website according to user needs.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="-what-project-i-worked-on">üìù What Project I Worked On:</h2>
<p>Today I again worked on the project which I started yesterday, today I worked on the font handling of the website means that I have provided the user with three options to set the font of the website. Website can be seen in three fonts:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Sans</li>
  <li>Sans-Serif</li>

<h2 id="-what-challenges-i-faced">üéØ What Challenges I Faced:</h2>
<p>The thing which caused me headache was setting up this blog with jekyll and github page. I almost spend 2-3 hours just jumping between errors and their solutions. But finally this thing is working. Sometime ruby build was failing and on the other time site test check was failing. Because of that I was not able to even send the blog to my mentor but now set up is done, I send him both the blogs.</p>

<h2 id="-whom-i-am-thankful-to">üôèüèª Whom I am Thankful To:</h2>
<p>It is quite difficult to think the content for this section because you can go in a wide range for this like we can even consider the code editor in my case vscode, thanking the developers for developing the software.I don‚Äôt know how you think about this.
This section help to think in a more like crazy way for gratitude.</p>

<h2 id="-reflection-and-my-feelings">üí≠ Reflection and My feelings:</h2>
<p>This training is no doubt adding value to my knowledge, but it is also helping me get to track again which I was not able to do because of some reason. It‚Äôs like in the morning there is new energy &amp; vibe to learn new things and give my best. So folks do the hard work and rest is the destiny.</p>]]></content><author><name>Satjeet Singh</name></author><category term="HTML" /><category term="CSS" /><category term="Web Development" /><category term="JavaScript" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[üóìÔ∏è Day 6 Of Summer Training]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Day 5 of Summer Training</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2025/06/27/day-5.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Day 5 of Summer Training" /><published>2025-06-27T00:00:00+05:30</published><updated>2025-06-27T00:00:00+05:30</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2025/06/27/day-5</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2025/06/27/day-5.html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="day-5-of-summer-training-">Day 5 of Summer Training üöÄ</h1>

<p>Welcome to <strong>Day 5</strong> of our summer training program! Today‚Äôs session was all about refining our front-end development skills and understanding how the browser renders elements.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="-what-i-learned-today">üîñ What I Learned Today</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Today I learned about open source contribution how pull requests work, what is the roadmap in order to contribute to the community, how talking with the maintainers is important before even start to code talking is the first and foremost step.</li>
  <li>Then I started the other project which is dictionary web app which also gives meaning, synonyms, pronunciation with a user-friendly theme.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2 id="-what-project-i-worked-on">üìÅ What Project I Worked On</h2>

<p>Today I worked on dictionary web app nav bar today I mainly worked on the theme change section which consists two things one is the toggle button and other is a moon icon. I analyzed the hover state and how the icon or button behaves on click event, then I started with HTML
in which to stimulate a toggle button, I used two divs. If we click on the toggle button or icon it will toggle the theme and I also tried to implement the feature that examines the user preferred theme(light/dark) and use that theme on the website.</p>

<p>Examples:</p>
<div class="language-html highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nt">&lt;header&gt;</span>
      <span class="nt">&lt;nav&gt;</span>
        <span class="nt">&lt;div</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">"flex align-items gap-15"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
          <span class="nt">&lt;div</span>
            <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">"scroll-btn flex align-center p-3 box-border clickable relative"</span>
          <span class="nt">&gt;</span>
            <span class="nt">&lt;div</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">"scroll-ball absolute"</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</span>
          <span class="nt">&lt;/div&gt;</span>
          <span class="nt">&lt;img</span> <span class="na">src=</span><span class="s">"/assets/icon-moon.svg"</span> <span class="na">alt=</span><span class="s">"moon"</span> <span class="nt">/&gt;</span>
        <span class="nt">&lt;/div&gt;</span>
      <span class="nt">&lt;/nav&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;/header&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="-whom-i-am-thankful-to">üôè Whom I am Thankful To:</h2>

<p>I am thankful to my mentor because of his guidance, I am able to learn about all the topics like Git &amp; GitHub, semantic HTML, clean code practices and many other things. A special thanks that I haven‚Äôt mentioned yet is to the website Frontend mentor because of that website I am able to practice my skills. This website consists of numerous practice projects ranging from easy to advanced level. If you haven‚Äôt checked that website yet consider visiting it.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="-what-challenges-i-faced">üöÄ What Challenges I Faced</h2>

<p>I honestly haven‚Äôt faced any difficulties and challenges today, everything was quite smooth.</p>

<h2 id="-reflections-and-my-feelings">üí≠ Reflections and My Feelings</h2>

<p>Today the schedule was quite hectic, it was difficult to manage training with it, but I managed to work for eight hours and why shouldn‚Äôt I because priorities matter. The things having the highest priority must to done at any cost.</p>]]></content><author><name>Satjeet Singh</name></author><category term="HTML" /><category term="CSS" /><category term="Web Development" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Day 5 of Summer Training üöÄ]]></summary></entry></feed>
